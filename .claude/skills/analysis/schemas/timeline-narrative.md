# Timeline & Narrative Schema

Build a chronological narrative of events with causal analysis.

## When to Use

Use this schema for:
- Breaking news stories that unfold over time
- Historical analysis of how a situation developed
- Crisis or incident analysis
- M&A deal timelines
- Policy development and implementation

## Output Structure

```markdown
# Timeline Analysis: {Topic}

**Period Covered:** {Start date} to {End date}
**Sources Analyzed:** {count} articles/documents
**Analysis Date:** {today}

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

{50-word overview of what happened and why it matters}

---

## TIMELINE OF EVENTS

### Phase 1: {Phase Name} ({Date Range})

**{Date}** — {Event Title}
- {What happened - 2-3 sentences}
- **Key actors:** {Who was involved}
- **Significance:** {Why this matters}
- **Source:** [{Publication}]({URL})

**{Date}** — {Event Title}
- {What happened}
- **Key actors:** {Who}
- **Significance:** {Why}
- **Source:** [{Publication}]({URL})

### Phase 2: {Phase Name} ({Date Range})

{Continue structure}

## VISUAL TIMELINE

```
{Start} ─────────────────────────────────────────────── {End}

## CAUSAL ANALYSIS

### Precipitating Factors

{What set the events in motion}

| Factor | Description | Evidence |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| {Factor 1} | {How it contributed} | {Source} |
| {Factor 2} | {How it contributed} | {Source} |

### Turning Points

{Moments that changed the trajectory}

| Date | Turning Point (16 words) | Impact |
|------|--------------------------|--------|
| {Date} | {What happened} | {How it changed things} |

### Chain of Causation

```
{Cause 1} → {Effect 1/Cause 2} → {Effect 2/Cause 3} → {Final Outcome}
```

---

## KEY ACTORS

| Actor | Role | Actions Taken | Motivations |
|-------|------|---------------|-------------|
| {Name} | {Title/Position} | {Key actions} | {Why} |

---

## WHAT CHANGED

### Before vs. After

| Dimension | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| {Aspect 1} | {State before} | {State after} |
| {Aspect 2} | {State before} | {State after} |

### Irreversible Changes

- {Change 1 that cannot be undone}
- {Change 2}

### Ongoing Developments

- {What is still unfolding}

---

## COUNTERFACTUAL ANALYSIS

{What might have happened differently}

| Decision Point | Actual Choice | Alternative | Possible Outcome |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| {Date/Event} | {What happened} | {What could have} | {How things might differ} |

## LESSONS & PATTERNS

{What this sequence of events teaches us}

- {Lesson 1 - exactly 16 words}
- {Lesson 2 - exactly 16 words}

## OPEN QUESTIONS

{What remains unclear or contested}

- {Question 1}
- {Question 2}

---

## SOURCES

### Primary Sources
- {Document/Statement}: [{Title}]({URL})

### News Coverage
| Date | Publication | Title | URL |
|------|-------------|-------|-----|
| {Date} | {Pub} | {Title} | {URL} |
```

## Extraction Guidelines

1. **Establish chronology first**: Get the dates right before analyzing
2. **Identify phases**: Group events into logical periods
3. **Find turning points**: What moments changed the trajectory?
4. **Trace causation**: What led to what?
5. **Note what's uncertain**: Flag contested facts or unknown details

## Causal Analysis Framework

When analyzing why events happened:

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| What were the **necessary conditions**? | Without X, would Y have happened? |
| What were the **sufficient conditions**? | Was X enough to cause Y? |
| What were the **triggers**? | What set things in motion? |
| What were the **accelerants**? | What made things happen faster? |
| What were the **constraints**? | What limited the range of outcomes? |

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] All dates verified against sources
- [ ] Events in correct chronological order
- [ ] Causal links supported by evidence
- [ ] Key actors and their roles identified
- [ ] Turning points clearly marked
- [ ] Open questions acknowledged
- [ ] All sources cited with dates
